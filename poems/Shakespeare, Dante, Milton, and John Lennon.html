    <h1>Shakespeare, Dante, Milton, and John Lennon</h1>
    <h2>By Matthew Barnhart</h2>
  </header>
    <p align="center">
      Shakespeare made well-known the English sonnet<br/>
      But wasn’t much for the pew or the hymns.<br/>
      He wrote no shortage of brilliance and wit,<br/>
      Twisting his words like wind twists willow limbs.<br/>
      Milton recounted current events, grim<br/>
      As politics, death, and his birthdays had,<br/>
      But lost sight of the world, like grey fog, sad<br/>
      And opaque, before it lost sight of him.<br/>
      Dante Alighieri, nearest the birth,<br/>
      Dabbled in cliché before it was so.<br/>
      Of fair ladies’ love and sweetness he wrote,<br/>
      Damning them to an inferno of mirth.<br/>
      Lennon was damned at too early an age.<br/>
      There’s no counting the lives he could have saved.
