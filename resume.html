              <p>
                Driven by your talents, you are a visionary thinker. Your vivid mental images of the coming months, years, or decades often impel you to move into action. By nature, you may sense that your life has deep meaning. With remarkable vividness, you occasionally imagine where you will be, what you will
                be doing, and what you will have the ability to accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. To some degree, your dreams of tomorrow are alive in your mind today. Perhaps you strive to transform these possibilities into reality. Chances are good that you intentionally take steps to be the mastermind of your own future. You refuse to leave your destiny to chance. You probably resist placing it in someone else’s hands. You trust your own intelligence and imagination when setting a direction for your life. Because of your strengths, you possess a high level of skill and/or knowledge
                about specialized issues, subjects, processes, or programs. You probably combine this expertise with
                your ability to set definite goals for the coming weeks, months, years, or decades. Instinctively, you
                might be an individual contributor who thinks about specific goals you want to reach in the coming
                months, years, or decades. Your imagination might pull you into the future even as you work on
                current assignments.

            </div>
            <div class="col-wide">
              <p>
                Instinctively, you are quite capable of holding your own in conversations with reasonable people. You
                appreciate individuals who share your commitment to search for truth. You continually fine tune your
                thinking about the key issues facing individuals and humankind. Topics can range from the ethical
                implications of biological research and its applications to freedom of expression. Because of your
                strengths, you routinely scan data to find meaningful and repetitious sequences. You tend ask
                yourself lots of questions about the numbers and/or the facts. You are delighted whenever you
                discover answers others typically overlook. You probably are more productive when you can work
                alone or have very few interruptions. Driven by your talents, you relish the nuances and intricacies of
                language. Your sophisticated or specialized vocabulary allows you to choose words for their power
                and clarity. Whether speaking or writing, you convey what you are thinking and feeling in a forceful,
                matter-of-fact manner. Usually no one has to second-guess — that is, wonder about — the true
                meaning of your intentions, messages, expectations, or orders. By nature, you need uninterrupted
                quiet time to be alone with your thoughts. Seldom do you automatically accept all the ideas of
                someone who has authored a book, been interviewed by the media, or been invited to address an
                audience. Instead, you scrutinize the theories and concepts of writers, speakers, and philosophers.
                You probably are a critical thinker. Chances are good that you engage others in conversation about
                the meaning of life. You discuss subjects beyond the understanding of the average mind. You afford
                individuals an opportunity to be creative, study, reflect, speculate, or tell stories. These activities
                stimulate your thinking. Undoubtedly, you prefer to spend time with intelligent people who can
                understand what you are saying.

              <h3>Input</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-wide">
              <p>
                Instinctively, you possess the physical and mental endurance needed to spend hours studying,
                reading, or researching. The more you know, the more questions you have to ask. Your diligence
                reflects your need to work harder and longer than most people can. You set lofty goals for yourself
                and relentlessly pursue them. Once you have reached your objective, you direct much of your energy
                toward a second goal. You are self-motivated. You prefer to push yourself rather than relax.
                By nature, you are a wordsmith — that is, a person who works with words. With ease, you collect hard-to-
                understand terms and their definitions. Whether you can use these immediately or months later is of no concern. You probably realize your sophisticated vocabulary is an “open sesame” — that is, words
                that unfailingly bring about a desired end. You are likely to speak or write in such a manner that the
                condition of humankind improves in a meaningful way. Because of your strengths, you are devoted to
                building your vocabulary. Each time you memorize a complicated or theoretical word and its meaning,
                you probably are eager to use it in conversations, discussions, or presentations. Undoubtedly, your
                work or studies demand that you continually add highly technical terms to your vocabulary. Chances
                are good that you thirst for new ideas and knowledge. Often you lose yourself in a book. You pore
                over the ideas contained on its pages for long stretches of time. Why? You want to absorb as much
                information as you can. Driven by your talents, you see yourself as highly qualified to perform
                specialized tasks. Undoubtedly, your uncommon vocabulary distinguishes you from the ordinary
                person. Adding words to your professional vocabulary indicates that your knowledge base is
                expanding. As a result, you can converse more easily with experts about a subject. Furthermore, you
                can understand what they are saying to one another.

              <p>
                Driven by your talents, you are quite comfortable being honest about yourself with others. You harbor
                very few illusions about who you really are. Furthermore, you can openly acknowledge your mistakes
                and shortcomings. This is apt to distinguish you from most people. By nature, you enjoy being busy,
                especially when you can assist someone in need. You are likely to be a good partner at home, in the
                workplace, at school, or in the community. You tend to do more than is expected of you. Why? You
                probably worry about wasting time. This explains your habits of volunteering for projects and asking
                for extra duties. Chances are good that you occasionally tell yourself that you are an effective mentor
                or trainer. Perhaps individuals benefit from the investment you make in them. Instinctively, you
                thoughtfully select your friends. You avoid rushing into relationships. Once you trust and care about
                someone, the individual probably seeks your counsel. Because of your strengths, you have close
                companions who frequently seek your guidance. You help them find answers to their personal and
                professional problems. This makes you a valuable friend.

                Because of your strengths, you may identify the specific traits or experiences that distinguish one
                person from the next. When you familiarize yourself with someone, you might be able to predict how
                the person will react in different situations. Driven by your talents, you aid others by concentrating
                their attention on objective and factual information. You probably examine data, review studies,
                conduct investigations, gather evidence, and decide what it all means. You are likely to document the
                steps so individuals can quickly reference the material later. Chances are good that you routinely
                study the factors coming together to create a situation. You definitely appreciate individuals who invite
                you to share your findings. It is not your style to boldly talk about your research. However, someone
                you trust can encourage you to speak. Instinctively, you may be inclined to double check your work.
                Perhaps you need to understand how one idea or fact links to whatever precedes or follows it. It’s
                very likely that you may be sought out for advice by individuals who appreciate your methodical
                thinking style. To some extent, your approach prevents people from being distracted by their own or
                someone else’s emotions. Perhaps you help them concentrate on the facts more than on than their
                feelings.
