<h1 align="center">Melvin: Part 1</h1>
<p>A broad sweeping kick to the gut crumples the masked bandit like paper, and a large burlap sack inscribed with a dollar sign thumps to the cold grey pavement. “POW!” the next frame reads in bright colors—red and yellow. The ink- black vigilante with crisp white eyes melds with the muted night buildings,  looming over his frightened foe. “It’s no use, fiend,” the white bubble reads, “I’ve already alerted the authorities of the exact sequence of bills you stole.” The words read in a confident baritone—“If you can’t spend it, money’s just a lot of worthless paper, isn’t it?” The criminal grimaces and narrows his eyes, “but how could you have known!? I’ve only just stolen it!” “Better three hours to soon than a minute too late,” the dark figure replies curtly. The criminal is swiftly hog-tied before the vigilante disappears into the ominous night. In the next frame red and blue lights flash idly. A group of police officers and a figure in a brown trench coat surround the bound and gagged would-be robber. Gotham is safe another night.
	A sudden “thump” rips Melvin from his paper fantasy. His back straightens instinctively, and he slaps the comic book closed on the desk. His frantically darting eyes land on the scowl of his boss, looming over him as Justice had loomed over Evil moments before. “Y-yes, sir?” Melvin stammers, still collecting himself. “I said,” his manager grunts, “we need to have a discussion.” “If you are not too busy,” he adds with a cynical tone that betrays his amusement with the discussion to come. “Of course I’m free, sir,” Melvin says, calming himself and swiveling his chair to focus his attentions on the boorish man standing stiffly at the entrance of his cubicle. “Good,” the boar replies dryly, “we need to talk about your performance.”</p>
	<p>“I’m aware it hasn’t been quite up to par—“</p>
	<p>“It’s been sub-par for quite some time, to say the least.”</p>
	<p>Melvin averts his gaze but continues, “not up to snuff lately, I know, by ever since my—“</p>
	<p>“Divorce, yes, I’m aware, Melvin, but that’s no excuse for you to be a mopey disappointment at the office. Leave your personal life at home, remember? Your sales are down 25% this month alone, and as we both know, they never had much room to slip to begin with. We feel like we’ve given you plenty of opportunities to improve, not to mention support and encouragement.”
	Melvin’s mind flitters away for a bitter aside, “’support and encouragement’ my ass; it’s been nothing but demands and impositions for years now!”
	<p>“That’s why we would like your desk packed and gone by the end of the—“</p>
	<p>“Fuck you.”</p>
	<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
	<p>“No, excuse me, sir, but I said, ‘fuck you,’ and thanks for the support.”</p></br>
	
	<p>The sun’s last rays only prick the horizon, the wound trickling receding pinks and blues. Melvin is unaware. His shades are drawn and only the light from the television screen permeates the darkness of his empty home like a fluorescent candle flickering in a deep cave—akin to one beneath Wayne Manor, he was once pleased to imagine. Unlike Bruce Wayne, who had Robin and Alfred Pennyworth to keep him company, Melvin’s remaining companion is merely a shadow of the real world. Melvin IS Pennyworth in this scenario he surmises.
	“I didn’t mean to forget about you,” he says apologetically, throwing a glance at the box of his belongings from the office, which is seated beside him on the couch. He imagines them offended by his neglect. He avoids the piercing stare of his family, the family he feels he no longer knows, from their flat, framed perch atop his other possessions. The state of his finances is the only connection he can maintain with them. Taking care of a family is never cheap, even when they are no longer around.
	With a heavy sigh Melvin peels himself out of the depression he has left in the couch and slowly meanders towards the kitchen, bored with the socially manufactured flashes that had burned his retinas all night. He grabs a long-neglected pile of mail from the unsullied kitchen table and regretfully sinks back into the couch. Carelessly, he tears open the top envelope (addressed from his bank) with his teeth, slides its contents out and tosses the envelope aside. He flips the folded pages open, and the bolded, bright red letters draw his eyes like a bug zapper enchants harried moths—“Repossession Notice.” His pupils dilate as he confusedly scans the document. He feels the sweat swelling beneath his skin as his scanning finds its destination—“If payment for the amount due above is not received within 30 days of the date on this notice, the recipient hereby relinquishes ownership of the property to State Bank.” Though he knows exactly where to look the information he now seeks, his eyes begin to frantically search the document again, from bottom to top. His heart begins to race and he feels its beating in his wrists, in his chest, in his temples. In a lucid moment, the fog clears and his groping eyes seize the letter’s date—</p>
<p>33 days ago.</p>
