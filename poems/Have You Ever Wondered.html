    <h1>Have you ever wondered what the inside of a stomach looks like?</h1>

I want to understand.<br/>
I hope they find something—nothing serious, just “something.”<br/>
I’m hungry.<br/>
Have you ever wondered what the inside of a stomach looks like?<br/><br/>

The ceiling stares back at me with stern lips.<br/>	
The pressed sheet of its surface is stark and blank.<br/>
It whispers warnings of “good luck.”<br/>
The blankets are warm, but the eyes are sterile and cold.<br/>
They just stare downward, bright and unblinking,<br/>
not caring to follow me as I pass.<br/>	
I think of bags of chips and pretzels, tins of popcorn<br/>
as the gurney rattles and clunks below me.<br/><br/>

God, I’m hungry.<br/><br/>

The procedure room is as uncaring as the faces surrounding me.<br/>
They smile, but they won’t feed me<br/>	
anything but twilight.<br/><br/>

Twilight. What is that? Where is that? Where am I?<br/>
Jesus, I’m hungry.<br/><br/>

“Good luck.”<br/><br/>

Jesus…?<br/><br/>	

Choking. I think.<br/>
At least… I think I think.<br/><br/>

Choking, coughing, sputtering.<br/>
Where am I?<br/>
Sunlight stings my eyes.<br/>	
I want to understand.<br/>
What did the doctors say?<br/>
Nothing?<br/>
Crying.<br/><br/>

“Don’t worry; the medication elicits a very emotional response from teenagers.”<br/><br/>	

Daddy, don’t leave me.<br/><br/>

The sunlight tickles my nose.<br/>
I don’t understand.<br/>
I remember I don’t understand.<br/>
Crying.<br/><br/>	

“I’m not going anywhere.”<br/><br/>

I’m not going anywhere.<br/><br/>

“They’ll figure it out.”<br/><br/>

I’m not going anywhere.<br/><br/>

Sunlight bathes my feet.<br/>
The room has more color, more furniture—<br/>
A plant, a T.V., and a nightstand in the corner.<br/>	
The blankets are warm, but the air in my nostrils is still sterile and cold.<br/><br/>

What did the doctors say?<br/>
Nothing?<br/>
Nothing…<br/>
They’ll figure it out.<br/>	
Can I see the pictures?<br/><br/>

“Sure, baby.”<br/><br/>

Daddy, I’m hungry.<br/><br/>

“We’ll ask the nurses.”
