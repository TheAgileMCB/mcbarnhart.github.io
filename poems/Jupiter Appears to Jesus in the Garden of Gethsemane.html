<h1>Jupiter Appears to Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane</h1>
<h3>M. Charles Barnhart</h3>

I am Jupiter, but who are you?
I am the sky; you are some Jew.
What do you know of godly acts?
Of labor? Of sacrifice? Of defending man?
You squander your time, a wandering bard,
garbed in ghost like pallid Cicero,
orating on your feet, about your feet.
<em>They go on and on about your feet!</em>
But who does your ramble protect?
What villains are slain by your parables?
Yes, you sacrifice your body, but what is that?
Surrender and defeat? 
You need not give, only receive.
You are like Sisyphus and his boulder,
but you are the rock—a firm and heavy load—
and Sisyphus, your horde, endlessly lifting you.
<em>Even your own people say you are so.</em>
And what do you know of the world of man?
Of women? Of wealth? Of greed’s command?
Of why men weep and why men toil?
You know duty, but without passion,
and what is love without this?
You surround yourself with countrymen,
but remain a vain foreigner,
and you guide their lives—
a compass with no map.

MY sons know more of the mortal world!
Take Hercules, who sacrificed of himself—
his body, his time, his love, AND his life!
Like your Daniel, he entered the lion’s den,
but emerged under Nemea’s proud skin—
and slew a giant like your King David.
<em>More correctly, he slew three.</em>
He protected great cities and the people within,
and no one was ashamed to know HIS name.
He routed rivers—the Alfeios and Pineiόs—
To clean the Divine Stables of Augeas,
whereas women sponge your filthy feet
while you raise your hands so that blind men may see.
And what of “the one you love,” that Lazarus?
<em>That man you let die to flaunt your tricks.</em>
For whom you wept and made a scene.
Who stood before his people, a time-odored corpse—	
rotted tufts of fur you pulled from Death’s pileus.
Here you kneel amongst your disciples,
weeping and wailing like a woman, even now.
You, so eager to present your powers days ago;
where was your humility then?
Where is your bravado now?
So, do it! Die! Martyr yourself!
I won’t see you here, on this high cloud.
Go to YOUR father; show him what you’ve done.
<em>Rather, what you have not.</em>
HE will surely be proud
and say, “That is MY son.”
