    <h1>Jupiter Appears to Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane</h1>
    <h2>M. Charles Barnhart</h2>
  </header>

 I am Jupiter, but who are you?</br>
I am the sky; you are some Jew.</br>
What do you know of godly acts?</br>
Of labor? Of sacrifice? Of defending man?</br>
You squander your time, a wandering bard,</br>
garbed in ghost like pallid Cicero,</br>
orating on your feet, about your feet.</br>
<em>They go on and on about your feet!</em></br>
But who does your ramble protect?</br>
What villains are slain by your parables?</br>
Yes, you sacrifice your body, but what is that?</br>
Surrender and defeat?</br> 
You need not give, only receive.</br>
You are like Sisyphus and his boulder,</br>
but you are the rock—a firm and heavy load—</br>
and Sisyphus, your horde, endlessly lifting you.</br>
<em>Even your own people say you are so.</em></br>
And what do you know of the world of man?</br>
Of women? Of wealth? Of greed’s command?</br>
Of why men weep and why men toil?</br>
You know duty, but without passion,</br>
and what is love without this?</br>
You surround yourself with countrymen,</br>
but remain a vain foreigner,</br>
and you guide their lives—</br>
a compass with no map.</br></br>

MY sons know more of the mortal world!</br>
Take Hercules, who sacrificed of himself—</br>
his body, his time, his love, <strong>and</strong> his life!</br>
Like your Daniel, he entered the lion’s den,</br>
but emerged under Nemea’s proud skin—</br>
and slew a giant like your King David.</br>
<em>More correctly, he slew three.</em></br>
He protected great cities and the people within,</br>
and no one was ashamed to know <strong>his</strong> name.</br>
He routed rivers—the Alfeios and Pineiόs—</br>
To clean the Divine Stables of Augeas,</br>
whereas women sponge your filthy feet</br>
while you raise your hands so that blind men may see.</br>
And what of “the one you love,” that Lazarus?</br>
<em>That man you let die to flaunt your tricks.</em></br>
For whom you wept and made a scene.</br>
Who stood before his people, a time-odored corpse—</br>	
rotted tufts of fur you pulled from Death’s pileus.</br>
Here you kneel amongst your disciples,</br>
weeping and wailing like a woman, even now.</br>
You, so eager to present your powers days ago;</br>
where was your humility then?</br>
Where is your bravado now?</br>
So, do it! Die! Martyr yourself!</br>
I won’t see you here, on this high cloud.</br>
Go to <strong>your</strong> father; show him what you’ve done.</br>
<em>Rather, what you have not.</em></br>
<strong>he</strong> will surely be proud</br>
and say, “That is <strong>my</strong> son.”
